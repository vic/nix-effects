# Hint resolver for diagnostic Errors.
#
# Pairs a suffix of the blame path with a Detail-classified pattern
# and maps it to a structured Hint record. Keys are position-first;
# no kernel-rule strings appear as keys or in hint text, so rule
# retirement never invalidates hints.
#
# Lookup:
#
#   resolve : Error -> Hint | null
#
# Walks the single-child chain from the given Error to the leaf,
# classifies the leaf's Detail pattern, and returns the hint
# registered under the *longest* matching leaf-anchored suffix of
# the path's position tags. Returns null when no entry matches or
# when the Error lacks a position (unwrapped leaf).
#
# Key syntax: `"<pos1>.<pos2>...<posN>::<pattern>"`. The N position
# tags must match the last N elements of the blame path, in order.
# Longest matching suffix wins; existing 1-position keys continue to
# work as tail-of-length-1 matches.
#
# A Hint is `{ _tag = "Hint"; text; category; severity; docLink; }`.
# The `_tag` keeps it terminal for `api.extractValue`; all other
# fields are plain data consumable by renderers, LSPs, docs, and
# linters. Severity is `"error"` at this layer. `docLink` points at
# a per-key anchor inside the auto-generated diag module page on
# `docs.kleisli.io`; the anchor slug matches the docs-site markdown
# renderer's slug for the corresponding heading text.
#
# Chain walking is stack-safe by construction: direct recursion up to
# `fastPathLimit` frames, then a `builtins.genericClosure` worklist
# that WHNF-forces the next Error node at each step. `deepSeq` is
# unsafe on recursive Error payloads; WHNF suffices because each step
# only reads `err.children` (one hop).

    Hint resolver for diagnostic Errors.

    Exports:

      classify : Error -> String
      hints    : { <key> = Hint; }

    A Hint is `{ _tag = "Hint"; text; category; severity; docLink; }`.
    The `_tag` marker keeps it terminal for `api.extractValue`, and
    the remaining fields are plain data consumable by renderers,
    LSPs, docs, and linters. Severity is `"error"` at this layer;
    `docLink` points at the per-key heading anchor on the
    auto-generated diag module page (`/nix-effects/core-api/diag`).
    The anchor slug matches the docs-site markdown renderer's
    heading-id slugification rule, so each hint's docLink lands
    precisely on the rendered section for its key.

    Keys encode a leaf-anchored suffix of the blame path plus the
    classifier pattern: `"<pos1>.<pos2>...<posN>::<pattern>"`. A key
    matches when its positions equal the last N tags of the blame
    path; `resolve` returns the hint under the longest matching
    suffix. Single-position keys are the 1-hop special case. Hint
    text is position-semantic: no kernel-rule strings, no source-file
    references.

    Chain walking recurses directly up to ${toString fastPathLimit}
    frames, then falls through to a `builtins.genericClosure` slow
    path that WHNF-forces the next node.
