# Algebraic structures as macro-generated datatypes.
#
# Each structure is a single-constructor datatype with named fields. Later
# fields depend on earlier ones through `fieldD`, so algebraic laws
# reference prior structure by name (`prev.op`, `prev.id`, `prev.comp`)
# instead of peeking into nested Σ-projections.
#
# The family of types:
#   MonoidOf A         — (op, e, assoc, lid, rid) over A.
#   CategoryOf Obj Hom — (id, comp, lid, rid, assoc) over (Obj, Hom).
#
# The family of instances:
#   natAddMonoid : MonoidOf Nat            — (Nat, +, 0).
#   natCategory  : CategoryOf Unit natHom  — one-object category whose
#                                            hom-set is (Nat, +, 0).
#
# Each instance is a Nix record exposing both the HOAS components (so
# downstream modules can refer to `.op`, `.comp`, etc. by name) and the
# bundled (ty, impl) pair that the kernel checks.
#
# The single non-trivial theorem lives here because it is categorical in
# flavour: composition in `natCategory` is commutative. The proof is one
# line once the instance exists — `annAddComm` gives exactly the witness
# that `comp` needs.
#
# A note on macro design: `Obj` and `Hom` are `datatypeP` parameters, not
# in-constructor data fields. The macro encodes data fields via kernel
# `descArg`, which only holds small types (`S : U 0`). A `U 0`-valued or
# `Π Obj. Π Obj. U 0`-valued field would live at `U 1` and so cannot be
# a description argument. Parameters thread through a plain Π-binder
# (`paramPi`), where no such restriction applies. This is the general
# recipe for datatypes that carry universe-level structure.
