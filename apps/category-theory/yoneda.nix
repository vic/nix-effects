# Yoneda's lemma as an equivalence of types.
#
# The library's previous chapters (`algebra.nix`, `functor.nix`) built a
# specific category and a specific functor on it. Yoneda's lemma is the
# general statement that sits behind the presheaf/representable-functor
# correspondence: for any point `a : A` and any type family `B : A → U`,
# the space of sections
#
#     Π(x:A). Eq(A, a, x) → B(x)
#
# is equivalent to the single fibre `B(a)`. Read through the types-as-
# groupoids lens: a "natural transformation" out of the representable
# presheaf `y(a)` is determined by its value on the universal element
# `(a, refl)`.
#
# The equivalence is witnessed by four verified terms:
#
#   yonedaEval : (Π(x:A). Eq(A,a,x) → B(x)) → B(a)          — evaluate at (a, refl)
#   yonedaLift : B(a) → Π(x:A). Eq(A,a,x) → B(x)            — transport along the path
#   evalLift   : Π(b). eval(lift(b)) = b                    — free by computation
#   liftEval   : Π(α). Π(x). Π(p). lift(eval(α))(x,p) = α(x,p) — by path induction
