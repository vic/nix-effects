# Diagnostic-walker workloads.
#
# The kernel's diagnostic layer (`fx.diag.error` / `fx.diag.pretty` /
# `fx.diag.hints`) ships with a stack-safety discipline: direct
# recursion up to depth 500, `builtins.genericClosure` beyond. The
# synthetic checks in `src/diag/**` validate correctness at 5000 deep;
# these workloads track the allocation cost of the same walkers so a
# regression in the fast/slow split (e.g. an accidental early switch
# to recursion, or loss of `builtins.seq` forcing on the slow path) is
# caught by the bench gate.
#
# A 5000-deep `nestUnder` chain is the canonical stress target from
# the kernel spec; all three workloads share it so alloc deltas are
# directly comparable. The chain is built inside the workload
# expression so the builder's allocation cost is included in the
# measurement — matching real use, where walkers run on errors
# produced during elaboration.
