## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **`Lift` primitive** — explicit cross-level transport. `Lift l m eq A : U(m)` for `A : U(l)` with bound witness `eq : Eq Level (max l m) m`; introducer `liftAt`, eliminator `lowerAt`. Smart constructor collapses idempotently at `l ≡ m` (`Lift l l _ A ≡ A`, `liftAt l l _ A a ≡ a`, `lowerAt l l _ A x ≡ x`). HOAS surface: `LiftAt` / `liftAt` / `lowerAt`
- **`natToLevel : Nat → Level`** — structurally reduces on closed Nats (`natToLevel zero ≡ levelZero`, `natToLevel (succ n) ≡ levelSuc (natToLevel n)`); stuck on neutrals. Asymmetric — no `levelToNat` rule
- **`scope.provide` / `scope.val`** — stateless scoped handlers (reader/val pattern). `scope.provide handlers body` installs `handlers` for `body`'s dynamic extent without touching state; unhandled effects rotate outward and outer state mutations survive unaffected. `scope.val` is a convenience wrapper named after Koka's `val` handler: takes an attrset of constant values and builds handlers via `handlersFromAttrs`. Credit: @sini (#19)
- **`bind.optionalArg` sentinel** — explicit marker for optional bindAttrs entries. `bindAttrs { x = optionalArg; ... }` probes via `has-handler` and omits `x` from the result when no handler is installed (Nix function defaults can then take over). `bind.comp` / `bind.fn` translate `lib.functionArgs`'s `true` (= has default) into this sentinel internally — the magic-coupling to `lib.functionArgs`'s output shape is now confined to the wrappers, and `bindAttrs`'s "non-comp value → `send name value`" contract is preserved literally for `true`

### Changed

- **Per-summand level on `descArg` / `descPi`** with bound witness `eq : Eq Level (max l k) k`. The summand sort `S` may live at level `l` ≤ description level `k`; cross-level transport at every introducer / eliminator is via `Lift`

### Fixed

- **Deep handler routing through bind chains around scope rotation.** `queue.append` and `queue.snoc` now preserve the `__rawResume` flag set by `effectRotate` on rotation continuation queues. Without this, `bind` chains wrapping a rotating `scope.provide` / `scope.run` / `scope.runWith` lost the flag mid-chain — the outer interpreter fell back to `resumeCompOrValue` instead of `resumeWithQueue`, so effectful resumes from outer handlers no longer routed through inner-scope handlers. `append` fix credit: @sini (#19); `snoc` fix closes the symmetric path on `kernel.bind`
- **`queue.append` fix preserved one-sided:** the flag is propagated from `q1` (the rotation continuation queue, which appears on the left at every current call site). `q2.__rawResume` is intentionally not propagated — no current call site produces it on the right

### Removed

- **`Sub-at-U` structural conv coercion** (CHECK trampoline's universe-cumulativity bridge). The kernel is non-cumulative: a term checked against `U(k)` must have inferred type exactly `U(k)` modulo `convLevel`. Cross-level transport is via explicit `Lift`

### Performance

- L=0 fast-paths in `interpF` (eval-side) and `interpHoasAt` (HOAS-side): when the description level is statically zero, emit the post-collapse form directly without `Lift`-wrap or extra closure-env entries. HOAS↔eval conv preserved (same Val under instantiation; smart constructor collapses Lift at equal levels)
- `desc-arg` / `desc-pi` eq-slot fast-path: when `(l, k) = (0, 0)` and `tm.eq` is syntactically `refl`, emit `mkRefl` directly without recursing through CHECK
- Bench gate excludes `symbols` / `symbolsBytes` from the alloc max-fold — these track interned-string growth (new tag names, test names, binder names), not workload work. Reported in blame with `codeSize: true` for visibility
- `queue.append` / `queue.snoc` only allocate the `__rawResume` overlay attrset when the source queue actually carries the flag; common-case `bind` chains pay only an `or false` lookup. Credit: @sini (#19)
- **Bench baseline recalibrated.** `queue.snoc`'s `__rawResume` preservation (the snoc fix above) adds one attrset lookup per `kernel.bind` on the Impure path. Alternative encodings (`ImpureRaw` comp variant, `//` overlay) pay the same cost in different alloc fields — the discriminator is structurally additive, so the snoc fix's correctness gain (deep handler routing through `bind (provide _ _) k`) costs the recalibration. PR #19's `queue.append` fix is on the per-effect path and not gate-visible. Affected workloads: `bindHeavy.s10k` +23‰, `nestedHandlers.d3_i1k` +11‰, `interp.{fib10,fib15,sum1000,countdown1000}` +6-14‰. Previous baseline preserved at `bench/history/baseline.pre-pr19.json` for future bind-path optimisation

## [0.10.0] - 2026-04-26

### Headline changes

#### Kernel

- **Universe-polymorphic descriptions and universes.** `Desc^k I`, `U(k)`, `descArg^k`, `descPi^k`, `descElim^k` carry an explicit universe level `k : Level`. The Tarski `Level` sort (`zero` / `suc` / `max`) inhabits `U(0)`; `convLevel` normalises level expressions modulo idempotence of `max`, distribution of `suc`, and zero absorption before comparing structurally
- **Conversion fast-paths.** Π-η reduction (`λx. f x ≡ f`) with `freshVar` sharing across both sides of `convVal`, plus a `convLevel a == b` syntactic-equality short-circuit **Description-of-descriptions.** `descDesc : Π(k:Level). Desc ⊤` describes descriptions themselves at any level. The `iso(D)` theorem is stateable in the kernel via the right-associated Σ shape `Π(k:Level). Σ(to). Σ(from). Σ(toFrom). fromTo`, and `from(to D) ≡ D` reduces structurally on prelude descriptions

#### Performance

- The representative cons-list construction workload is alloc-neutral against the 0.9.0 baseline (primOpCalls ±0‰; sets −26.6‰), and the full quick-tier alloc gate passes

#### Tooling and surface

- **Dual-metric bench harness** (`bench/`). `bench-run` samples each workload N times and records `NIX_SHOW_STATS` allocation counters plus cpu percentiles under `bench/history/<name>.{json,md}`. `bench-gate` classifies a run against the committed baseline, demotes hard-fails matched by `Perf-regression: <workload>, <reason>` commit trailers to "overridden", and runs **alloc-only in CI** (shared runners have too much cpu variance against a workstation-captured baseline). `bench-calibrate`, `bench-compare`, `bench-open-regressions`, and `bench-lint-workloads` round out the toolchain as flake packages. Per-workload cpu budgets, `noiseLimited` (cpu-axis) and `allocNoiseLimited` (alloc-axis) exclusion arrays, a Nix-version guard, and typo / missing-registry guards ship in `bench/budgets.toml` + `bench/runner/finalize-gate.nix`
- **Kernel diagnostic surface.** `H.checkHoas` / `H.inferHoas` now attach a `hint` string and a `surface` HOAS-node pointer to every type-error, lazily — only the failure branch materialises the walker. Powered by a position-stack effect in the `runCheck` handler (`src/tc/check/ctx.nix`), a `bindP pos m k` bracket combinator that tags sub-delegations with structural `Position`s, and a SourceMap mirror tree (`src/tc/hoas/source_map.nix`) keyed on the same `Position` alphabet
- **Bool / Void retired as primitives.** `H.bool = μ ⊤ (plus (retI tt) (retI tt)) tt`, `H.void = Fin 0`, `H.boolElim` via `descInd`, `H.absurd` via direct `J`-transport through `natCaseU`. Six `Tm` constructors, four `Val` constructors, two `Elim` frames, twelve dispatch cases, and ~60 lines of dead helpers leave the TCB. API surface unchanged **Indexed datatype macro.** `datatypeI` and `datatypePI` compile arbitrary-indexed inductive families atop the ⊤-indexed `datatype` / `datatypeP`. `FinDT`, `VecDT`, `EqDT` replace the hand-written description / constructor / eliminator triples; ~260 lines collapse to 25 lines of forwarders
- **Path-threaded `typeCheck` effect.** `Type.validateAt path v` recurses structural path segments through `Record`, `ListOf`, `Variant`, `Sigma`. Value-side and kernel-side Errors now share one `Position` ADT, so a single pretty-printer and hint-resolver cover both

### Added

#### Kernel — Level sort

- `Level` sort with `mkLevel`, `mkLevelZero`, `mkLevelSuc`, `mkLevelMax`, `mkLevelLit n` term constructors and `vLevel*` value mirrors. `convLevel` normaliser modulo idempotence, distribution of `suc`, zero absorption, and sorted-spine `max`, plus an `a == b` syntactic-equality fast-path
- `vLevelMaxOpt` — drop-zero-if-dominated optimisation for
  `vLevelMax`, applied in `descInd` `K_eff` reconstruction
- `reifyLevel` — closes the kernel↔HOAS round-trip for polymorphic levels

#### Kernel — Universe-polymorphic primitives

- `descDesc : Π(k:Level). Desc ⊤` — kernel-internal description of descriptions, threaded for the `iso(D)` weak-levitation theorem
- Universe-polymorphic `descElim` (leading `K : Level` slot matching the description's level) and heterogeneous `funext` (`Π(j:Level). Π(k:Level)` with decoupled domain/codomain levels)
- `checkDescAtAnyLevel` — bidirectional bridge that infers the description's universe level from a checked target type before delegating to the level-indexed description CHECK rules
- Π-η conversion with `freshVar` sharing across both sides of `convVal`

#### Tooling and surface

- `datatypeI name I consList` / `datatypePI name params indexFn mkCons` with `conI` / `recFieldAt` spec constructors; `FinDT` / `VecDT` / `EqDT` scope bindings
- `fx.effects.hasHandler : String → Computation Bool` (reserves the effect name `"has-handler"`) Deep handler semantics for effect rotation (Plotkin & Pretnar): raw resumes from an outer handler route back through the inner scope
- `.github/workflows/bench-gate.yml` — alloc-only CI gate per push / PR, with step-summary publication
- Short-alias `bench-*` commands alongside `nix-effects-bench-*` via a `bench-shims` derivation in `shell.nix`
- `bench/workloads/tc/{bindP,diag}.nix` canaries; `tc.e2e.let-chain-100`

### Changed

- **Breaking:** description and universe constructors take a leading `Level` slot. `vDesc`, `vDescArg`, `vDescPi`, `vU`, `mkDesc`, `mkDescArg`, `mkDescPi`, `mkDescElim`, `mkU` accept a `Level` Val/Tm; integer literals must be wrapped explicitly via `mkLevelZero` / `mkLevelLit n` (or `vLevelZero` / `vLevelSuc vLevelZero` for the common 0/1 cases)
- `StrEq` INFER rule returns the derived `H.bool`; `reifyType` recognises the plus-coproduct mu shape and maps back to `H.bool`
- Fin / Vec / Eq preludes in `hoas/combinators.nix` are η-expanded forwarders over macro outputs; `absurdFin0` discharges `Fin 0` via direct `J`-transport through `natCaseU`
- `readSrc` (`default.nix`) recurses into subdirectories uniformly in both split-module and plain-namespace modes; every output is `api.mk`-wrapped

### Removed

- Kernel `Tm` constructors `Bool` / `True` / `False` / `BoolElim` / `Void` / `Absurd`; kernel `Val` constructors `VBool` / `VTrue` / `VFalse` / `VVoid`; `Elim` frames `EBoolElim` / `EAbsurd`; HOAS aliases `boolPrim` / `truePrim_` / `falsePrim_` / `voidPrim` / `absurdPrim` / `boolElimPrim`; dead helpers `natDisc` / `noConfSuccZero` / `symNat`

## [0.9.0] - 2026-04-18

Descriptions become indexed. `Desc` and `μ` previously classified only `⊤`-indexed datatypes; they now take an arbitrary index type `I`, so `μ D : I → U` picks out a family of types rather than a single type. This is the machinery needed for length-indexed vectors, `Fin n`, propositional equality-as-a-description, and anything else that carries a value at the type level. The old unindexed combinators (`desc`, `mu`, `descRet`, `descRec`, `descPi`) remain as `⊤`-slice aliases, so the datatype macro and every downstream consumer — `Nat`, `List`, `Sum`, the category-theory library — keep working unchanged. A latent de Bruijn off-by-one in the value-level description eliminator is fixed en route.

### Added

- **Indexed descriptions** (`Desc I`) — `descI`, `muI`, `retI`, `recI`, `piI` at any index type. `descCon D i d` and `descInd D motive step i scrut` thread the target index; `VMu` / `vMu` / `mkMu` carry `I` alongside `D` and `i` so the kernel's `desc-con` CHECK rule recovers the index type from the surrounding `μ` without re-inferring the description
- **Acceptance coverage at non-`⊤` indices** — positive tests at `Desc Nat` and `Desc Bool` exercise `retI`, `recI`, and `piI` with a bool-dependent index function, plus an index-mismatch rejection at `Desc Bool` against a `Nat` literal and a `muI` at a matching target index
- **`J`-transport inside the `datatype` macro** — `dispatchStep` transports each constructor's step through the leaf `Eq ⊤ tt iArg` witness via the kernel's `J` primitive. Without Axiom K, MLTT cannot definitionally collapse `VRefl ≡ VNe(eq)`; routing through `J` is the principled transport
- **Pinned invariants for de Bruijn indices under `Π _:S. _` binders** — three tests assert that `interpOnArg` / `interpOnPi` / `allOnPi` quote their index-referencing Pi-domain codomain to the literal index value, not to the fresh-Var binding for `S`, when evaluated on a stuck `vDescElim` forced by `V.vNe 0 []`

### Changed

- **`desc-con` CHECK rule checks the description instead of inferring it** — `tm.D` is checked against `Desc ty.I`, using the index type recovered from the surrounding `μ`. Preserves strict bidirectional discipline: canonical intro forms at index positions (`tt`, `zero`, `refl`) remain checkable-only
- **`⊤`-slice aliases become thin wrappers** — `mu = D: i: muI unit D i`, `descRet = retI tt`, `descRec D = recI tt D`, `descPi S D = piI S (ann (λ_.tt) (S → ⊤)) D`, `desc = descI unit`. The datatype macro and the prelude descriptions `natDesc` / `listDesc` / `sumDesc` route through these aliases, so their behaviour is unchanged. `descCon` and `descInd` match kernel arities exactly (no alias): at `I = ⊤`, call sites write `tt` explicitly at the index position
- **Dead adapter branches deleted** — the `nat-elim` / `list-elim` / `sum-elim` branches in `hoas/elaborate.nix` were unreachable once `NatDT` / `ListDT` / `SumDT` migrated to the macro-generated elim path in 0.8.0. Removed

### Fixed

- **de Bruijn off-by-one in the value-level description eliminator.** Under a `Π _:S. _` binder inside `interpOnArg` / `interpOnPi` / `allOnPi` / `evOnPi`, the closure env is `[_, S, I]`, so references to the index type `I` must use `Var 2` — not `Var 1`, which resolves to `S`. Latent because `vDescElim` fully reduces on a concrete `VDesc*` and drops the intermediate Pi-domain annotations; observable only under `VNe + eDescElim` (e.g. `natDesc`'s inner `boolElim` stuck on a `Σ`-bound variable). Regression tests pin the invariant at three of the four sites

## [0.8.0] - 2026-04-17

A macro layer for user-defined datatypes lands on top of the kernel's description universe. Declaring an inductive type now means naming its fields; the macro compiles them to descriptions, flattens saturated and linear-recursive constructor chains to flat `desc-con` terms at elaboration time, and threads type parameters through a plain Π-binder so universe-typed components sit at the outside of the definition. `Nat`, `List`, and `Sum` are rebuilt through this surface. The category-theory example library is rewritten as a five-chapter guided tour that uses exactly the same macros users have.

### Added

- **Datatype macro layer** (`fx.types.hoas.datatype` / `fx.types.hoas.datatypeP` + `field`, `fieldD`, `piField`, `piFieldD`, `recField`) — declarative HOAS surface for single- or multi-constructor inductive types. Dependent fields receive a `prev` marker map so later fields reference earlier ones by name; `datatypeP` parameters thread through a `paramPi` (plain Π) binder, outside the description's `descArg`; duplicate constructor names and zero-constructor datatypes are rejected eagerly
- **Constructor-chain flattening at elaboration** — saturated (all-data) and linear-recursive (data-fields then one `rec`) shapes flatten to a single `desc-con` Tm (or a `genericClosure`-walked pyramid for the recursive shape). Deeply nested constructor applications (5000+ cons cells, 5000+ succs) type-check without blowing the C++ stack. Non-flattenable shapes fall through to the ann-wrapped λ-cascade path and behave identically to the pre-macro spelling
- **`W`-type datatype macro** — self-application inside `datatypeP` for M-like datatypes (`W A P` with `A : U₀`, `P : A → U₀`, `sup : Π a. (P a → W) → W`)
- **Dependent-field laws in the macro surface** — `fieldD`'s type function receives the full `prev` marker map, so associativity laws reference `prev.op`, category laws reference `prev.id` / `prev.comp`, etc. No projection chains
- **Category-theory library rewritten as a guided tour** — five chapters that build on each other:
  - `combinators.nix` — `sym`/`trans`/`cong` from J.
  - `arithmetic.nix` — `add` with seven verified properties.
  - `algebra.nix` — `Monoid` and `Category` as macro datatypes; instances `natAddMonoid`, `natCategory`; `compComm` stated categorically through `natCategory.comp`.
  - `functor.nix` — `MonoidHom` and `Functor` as macro datatypes; doubling packaged as both `doubleHom` (monoid homomorphism) and `doubleFunctor` (endofunctor on `natCategory`).
  - `yoneda.nix` — Yoneda's lemma as an equivalence of types.

### Changed

- **`Nat`, `List`, `Sum` use the macro surface for their µ/ctor/elim construction** — their HOAS forwarding stays unchanged from the user view; internally they flow through `datatype` / `datatypeP`, so every test-suite improvement on the macro improves the kernel primitives too
- **`apps/category-theory/algebra.nix`** — old nested-Σ `MonoidOf` / `CategoryTy` encoding replaced by macro datatypes. `natAddMonoid` and `natCategory` are exposed as HOAS records carrying both the component HOAS terms (`.op`, `.e`, `.comp`, …) and the bundled `(ty, impl)` pair that the kernel checks
- **Example-library invocations** — README and apps use `nix eval` rather than `nix-instantiate --eval --strict`

### Documented

- **`desc-arg` universe rule** — a principled note at check.nix's `desc-arg` rule explains why `S : U 0` is required, the parameter-lifting idiom that threads universe-typed components through `datatypeP` parameters, and that the category-theory library currently encodes `Obj` / `Hom` as parameters specifically because of this rule

## [0.7.0] - 2026-04-16

Six upstream PRs land alongside a kernel-level description universe. From @vic: Kyo-style handler rotation and a `scope` module for lexically scoped handlers (#8), `bind.*` operators for attrset/computation/function composition (#12), an `isComp` predicate on the computation ADT (#13), a first-class `state.update` (#15), and CI for pull requests (#16). From @sini (first contribution, landing via #14): effectful-resume handlers that can reply with a computation and have its effects spliced into the continuation. Thanks to both.

On the kernel side, `Desc` and `μ` join as primitives, and `Nat`, `List`, `Sum`, and `Unit` are rebuilt as HOAS descriptions on top — so further inductives can be added as ordinary data rather than new kernel nodes. Σ-η and ⊤-η conversion rules are added. A follow-up fix (`effectRotateSlow` now splices computation resumes correctly; see Fixed) closes a bug found during review of #14.

### Added

- **Kyo-style handler rotation** (`fx.rotate`) — handles matching effects and rotates unknown ones outward so an enclosing handler can resume them. Implements the law `handle(t1, suspend(t2, i, k), f) = suspend(t2, i, x → handle(t1, k(x), f))`. Credit: @vic (#8)
- **Scoped handlers** (`fx.effects.scope`) — `scope.run` installs handlers for a subcomputation and hides the scope's internal state, `scope.runWith` exposes it, and `scope.stateful` threads caller state across rotation. Credit: @vic (#8)
- **Effectful-resume handlers** — a handler may return a computation as its `resume` value; its effects are spliced before the pending continuation. Fast path uses `resumeCompOrValue` which dispatches on whether the resume is a computation. Credit: @sini (#14)
- **Description universe in the kernel** — `Desc` and `μ` as kernel primitives, with strict positivity guard, HOAS descriptor pieces (`descArg`, `descRec`, `descPi`, `descRet`), `descElim`/`descInd` elimination, and `interpHoas` for description interpretation
- **Nat/List/Sum/Unit rebound as HOAS descriptions** — kernel representations live entirely in the description universe; no dedicated kernel nodes for each type
- **Σ-η and ⊤-η conv rules** — `pair (fst p) (snd p) ≡ p` for Sigma and `tt ≡ _` for Unit, at the kernel conversion level
- **`bind.*` operators** — `bindAttrs`, `bindFx`, `bindFn` for monadic composition over attrset projections, computations, and Kleisli arrows. Credit: @vic (#12)
- **`state.update`** — effectful state transformer obeying `get >>= f >>= ({s, v}: put s >> pure v)`. Credit: @vic (#15)
- **`isComp`** — tag-based predicate on the computation ADT boundary. Credit: @vic (#13)
- **Pull-request CI** (`.github/workflows/flake-check.yml`) — runs `nix flake check -L` on PR events. Credit: @vic (#16)
- **CI and release badges** on the README

### Fixed

- **`effectRotateSlow` now splices computation resumes correctly.** When the depth ≥ 500 fast-to-slow threshold was crossed and a handler returned a computation as its `resume`, the slow path previously used `resumeWithQueue`, which treats the resume as a plain value. For the common case of an Identity continuation queue this wrapped the computation in `pure`, short-circuiting the loop with the inner effects unrun. Swap to `resumeCompOrValue` to match the fast path. Regression test: `effectRotationSlowPathEffectfulResume`.

### Changed

- **README** — rewritten intro, new `## Features` section covering effects-layer and MLTT kernel capabilities, old "No handler layering" limitation removed (superseded by `fx.effects.scope`), old "single source of truth" paragraph refocused on the real underlying limitation (`Certified` carries a Boolean witness, not an inhabitation proof)

## [0.6.0] - 2026-04-14

### Added

- **Opaque lambda** (`mkOpaqueLam`) — trust boundary for negative types (Pi). The kernel verifies domain match but cannot reduce the body. Follows the axiomatized literal pattern (`mkFnLit`/`mkAnyLit`). Conv uses `_fnBox` wrapper for thunk-identity comparison
- **Verified combinators** (`src/tc/verified.nix`) — `fn` combinator produces values carrying both a Nix callable (`__functor`) and an HOAS body (`_hoasImpl`). The kernel type-checks the full body, not just domain
- **Pi elaboration** — `elaborateValue` handles Pi types: verified values use `_hoasImpl` directly, raw Nix functions wrap in opaque lambda. `extractInner` returns Nix functions from `VOpaqueLam` and `VLam`
- **HOAS substitution for dependent Sigma** — `elaborateValue` Sigma case uses `body(â)` for correct dependent type computation, replacing the sentinel test heuristic
- **`_kernelPrecise` / `_kernelSufficient`** — orthogonal decomposition of the old `_kernelExact`. `_kernelPrecise` drives parent kernel building; `_kernelSufficient` drives guard decisions. Constructors compose both independently
- **`.diagnose` method** on all types — returns `{ kernel; guard; agreement; }` for independent kernel/guard reporting
- **Category theory library** (`apps/category-theory/`) — formally verified proofs running at Nix eval time. Proof combinators (sym, trans, cong) derived from J elimination; natural number arithmetic with 7 verified properties including commutativity; Monoid and Category as dependent sigma types with (Nat,+,0) instances; commutativity of composition in the endomorphism monoid; doubling endofunctor with functoriality proof via 5-step equational rewriting
- **Cross-cutting integration tests** — Record(Pi, Sigma(refined)), Maybe(DepRecord(dependent ListOf)), ListOf(Pi), Either(Sigma, Pi) verifying conjunction across compound types

### Changed

- **Universal conjunction** — every type with a guard uses `kernelDecide ∧ guard`. Replacement mode removed entirely from `effectiveCheck`
- **Polarity-aware elaboration** — positive types (Sigma, Sum, Nat) elaborate structurally; negative types (Pi) elaborate opaquely
- **Pair syntax** — `mkPair` is now 2-arg (Curry-style), removing the vestigial Church-style annotation that no computational layer maintained. Pair inference case removed from `check.nix`; use `Ann` for synthesis
- **Pi guard removed** — Pi with `kernelType` sets `guard = null`; opaque lambda domain check subsumes `isFunction`
- **Refined types** set `approximate = false`, enabling parent constructors to build precise kernels from refined children under conjunction
- **Constructor composition** — `Record`, `ListOf`, `Maybe`, `Either`, `Variant` split decisions into `allPrecise` (kernel building) and `allSufficient` (guard propagation)
- **DepRecord** `buildSigma` uses `_kernelPrecise` for precise nested Sigma kernels on non-dependent fields

### Removed

- `_kernelExact` — replaced by `_kernelPrecise` / `_kernelSufficient` with no backward-compatibility shim
- Replacement mode in `effectiveCheck` — all types use conjunction
- Pair inference case in `check.nix` — introduction forms check, not synthesize

## [0.5.2] - 2026-04-13

### Fixed

- **Soundness: refined type composition** — `refine`/`refined` exposed `_kernel` without marking themselves approximate, allowing `Maybe`/`Either` to bypass refinement predicates via the weaker kernel. `Maybe (refined "Nat" Int (x: x >= 0)).check (-1)` returned `true`. Fixed via Galois connection model: `_kernelExact` separates kernel availability from sufficiency, dual-mode conjunction/replacement semantics in `mkType`
- **`elaborate.decide` totality for records** — `elaborateValue` record case did raw `v.${field}` access without checking field presence. Missing-attribute errors are uncatchable by `builtins.tryEval`, making `decide` crash instead of returning `false`. Fixed with safe `fieldOf` helper

### Added

- `_kernelExact` field on all types — `true` when the kernel alone is sufficient for correct checking (no guard residual needed)
- `Record` per-field blame tracking via custom `verify` — delegates to each field type's `.validate` for recursive decomposition (context: `Record{age, name}.age`)
- `Variant` per-branch blame tracking via custom `verify` — delegates to active branch's `.validate`
- Composition soundness tests: deep composition, kernel-exact propagation, chained refinements, adequacy property

### Changed

- Type constructors (`Record`, `ListOf`, `Maybe`, `Either`, `Variant`) use `_kernelExact` instead of `? _kernel` for guard decisions and set explicit `approximate` flags
- `_kernel` is now always exposed on all types as the best kernel approximation; `kernelCheck` and `prove` remain gated on `!isApproximate`
- `Pi` without explicit `kernelType` omits redundant `isFunction` guard (conjunction with `kernelDecide` handles it)
- Locked nixpkgs via `nixpkgs.nix` for deterministic non-flake builds (@vic, kleisli-io/nix-effects#9)

## [0.5.1] - 2026-04-13

### Changed

- `Justfile`: `just test` now accepts an optional suite argument (`just test <suite>`) to selectively run a single test suite instead of all tests (kleisli-io/nix-effects#11, contributed by @vic)

## [0.5.0] - 2026-04-12

### Added

- `comp.nix`: Computation ADT module — single source of truth for `Pure`/`Impure` construction and elimination via `pure`, `impure`, `isPure`, and `match`. All modules now use these constructors instead of raw `_tag` attrset literals (closes #7)
- `kernel.pipe`: chain a computation through Kleisli arrows, threading results via bind (closes #6)
- `kernel.kleisli`: Kleisli composition `(a -> M b) -> (b -> M c) -> (a -> M c)`
- `queue.identity`: sentinel variant representing the identity continuation, letting the trampoline skip queue application for bare `send` effects
- Benchmark infrastructure: `nix run .#bench` / `nix run .#bench-compare` with named history, 3-run median, and comparison tables
- Benchmark apps: expression interpreter (`apps/interp`) and dependency graph evaluator (`apps/build-sim`) with scalable workload generators
- Benchmark stress tests: effectHeavy, bindHeavy, mixed, rawGC microbenchmarks for diagnosing bottlenecks
- Per-module test result reporting in `tests` output

### Changed

- Trampoline interpreter processes continuation queues inline via recursive `applyQueue` (depth-limited to 500, with genericClosure fallback for deep pure chains), keeping 1 genericClosure step per effect — 78% faster on effectHeavy 100k, 72% faster on mixed 100k vs 0.4.0
- `send` uses Identity queue instead of `singleton pure`, eliminating one wasted identity continuation application per effect
- `queue.viewlGo` fast-path: returns immediately when left child is already a Leaf, skipping genericClosure entry for the common case
- `queue.snoc` and `queue.append` handle Identity variant transparently
- All source modules migrated from raw `{ _tag = "Pure"; ... }` / `{ _tag = "Impure"; ... }` literals to `comp.pure` / `comp.impure` constructors, and from `._tag == "Pure"` checks to `comp.isPure`
- README and book reframed around the effect layer as the primary abstraction; removed Fire Triangle framing
- Book: trampoline guide updated to use `isPure`

### Fixed

- `build.materialize`: step-script env test matched exact quoting instead of presence

### Removed

- `examples/typed-derivation.nix` and the proof-gated derivation showcase wired through it. The example was contrived (the same policy is expressible with `assert`) and did not reflect how the library is actually used. The `api-server` package output and the book's "Proof-gated derivations" section in the Proof Guide are removed along with it. The `v.verify` verified-extraction pipeline it demonstrated is still available and documented in the remaining `examples/` and in the Proof Guide.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-04-06

### Changed

- **Breaking:** `mk`-wrapped functions are now directly callable, removing the need for `.value` (@vic, #1)
- Test extraction produces nested attrsets instead of flat dotted keys, enabling targeted `nix-unit` runs (@vic, #5)

### Added

- `CONTRIBUTING.md` explaining the josh mirror workflow
- `shell.nix`, `Justfile`, `tests.nix` for non-flake dev workflow (@vic, #4)

### Removed

- Unused flake inputs (@vic, #3)

## [0.3.0] - 2026-02-27

### Added

- Effects-powered build module (`fx.build`): typed build steps, eval-time validation, and derivation materialization
- `fx.build.BuildStep` and `fx.build.BuildPlan` Record types for describing build pipelines
- `fx.build.plan`: eval-time validation pipeline that type-checks steps and filters conditional steps via `when` predicates, collecting all errors without throwing
- `fx.build.materialize`: converts a validated BuildPlan + pkgs into a `pkgs.runCommand` derivation with per-step env isolation, source copying, and shell generation

## [0.2.0] - 2026-02-27

### Added

- Typed pipeline framework (`fx.pipeline`): composable stages with `mkStage`, `compose`, and `run`, wiring reader, error, acc, and typecheck effects with typed boundaries between stages
- Pipeline convenience re-exports: `ask`, `asks`, `raise`, `raiseWith`, `warn`, `pure`, `bind`, `map` for use inside stage transforms
- 14 inline tests and 2 integration tests for the pipeline module

## [0.1.0] - 2026-02-25

Initial release.

### Added

- Freer monad core with FTCQueue (O(1) bind) and `genericClosure` trampoline (O(1) stack depth)
- MLTT type-checking kernel (`src/tc/`) with bidirectional type checking and normalization by evaluation
- HOAS elaboration bridge between Nix values and kernel terms
- Verified computation layer: prove functions total, extract certified Nix functions from proof terms
- Proof-gated derivation builder: reject invalid configs at `nix eval` time via kernel proof obligations
- Primitive types: String, Int, Bool, Float, Attrs, Path, Function, Null, Unit, Any
- Compound type constructors: Record, ListOf, Maybe, Either, Variant
- Dependent types: Pi, Sigma, Certified, Vector, DepRecord
- Refinement types with predicate combinators: `refined`, `allOf`, `anyOf`, `negate`, `positive`, `nonNegative`, `inRange`, `nonEmpty`, `matching`
- Linear types: Linear, Affine, Graded
- Universe hierarchy: `typeAt n` for arbitrary levels, convenience aliases Type_0 through Type_4
- Algebraic effect handlers: state, error, reader, writer, acc, choice, conditions, typecheck, linear
- Handler `resume`/`abort` distinction for continuation control
- Effectful lazy streams: `fromList`, `iterate`, `range`, `replicate`, `map`, `filter`, `scanl`, `take`, `takeWhile`, `drop`, `fold`, `toList`, `length`, `sum`, `any`, `all`, `concat`, `interleave`, `zip`, `zipWith`
- `adapt` and `adaptHandlers` for handler state composition
- `mk { doc, value, tests }` structured module pattern with inline documentation and tests
- `extractDocs` for per-module API markdown generation
- Flake with lib, tests, packages, and checks outputs
- nix-unit integration for `nix flake check`
- Documentation: 8 book chapters (introduction, getting started, proof guide, theory, trampoline, systems architecture, kernel architecture, kernel formal specification)
- Examples: equality proofs, proof basics, typed derivation, verified functions
